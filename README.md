# Orbital-Project-HobbyLand

Proposed level of achievement :
Project Gemini

Motivation :

We have always wanted to try working on a project together and this orbital project has provided us with the perfect platform to try building a technologically related project and at the same time self-learn several skills along the way.

As students in the pandemic era, we have experienced troubles meeting people in general and faced even more difficulty meeting people with the same interests in school. In online classes, most students do not even turn on their cameras, much less interact outside of class. In physical classes, students prioritize academics ahead of socializing. This left us wondering, how can we form meaningful and long lasting friendships in this period?

Aim :

We aim to make a webpage that connects students based on different categories such as faculties, course of study and even personal hobbies etc.

User Stories :

As a student, I wish to be able to find more students in the faculty so as to form a solid support system.
As a freshman, I hope that I can have a senior/mentor to guide me through my university life.
As a senior, I would like to enrich the lives of juniors in all ways I can by providing the help they need and in turn form meaningful relationships.
As a student, I wish to find more friends who share the same interests as me.
As an administrator who wants to enhance user experience, I want to be able to provide the most suitable matches for users by incorporating a system where users are matched based on how similar they are.
