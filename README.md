# Orbital-Project-HobbyLand

Proposed level of achievement :
Project Gemini

Motivation :

We have always wanted to try working on a project together and this orbital project has provided us with the perfect platform to try building a technologically related project and at the same time self-learn several skills along the way.

As students in the pandemic era, we have experienced troubles meeting people in general and faced even more difficulty meeting people with the same interests in school. In online classes, most students do not even turn on their cameras, much less interact outside of class. In physical classes, students prioritize academics ahead of socializing. This left us wondering, how can we form meaningful and long lasting friendships in this period?

Aim :

We aim to make a webpage that connects students based on different categories such as faculties, course of study and even personal hobbies etc.

User Stories :

As a student, I wish to be able to find more students in the faculty so as to form a solid support system.
As a freshman, I hope that I can have a senior/mentor to guide me through my university life.
As a senior, I would like to enrich the lives of juniors in all ways I can by providing the help they need and in turn form meaningful relationships.
As a student, I wish to find more friends who share the same interests as me.
As an administrator who wants to enhance user experience, I want to be able to provide the most suitable matches for users by incorporating a system where users are matched based on how similar they are.

Tech Stack :

HTML <br/>
CSS <br/>
Javascript <br/>
Firebase <br/>
Python <br/>


Development plan : <br/>
3rd week of May: Finalized pitch for Orbital Lift-off <br/>
4th week of May: Pick up necessary technologies - HTML, CSS, Javascript <br/>
5th week of May: Created Mockup <br/>
1st week of June: Finalized login,sign up page. Add to homepage (home screen, features tab) <br/>
2nd week of June: Start working on the main portal (user interface, matchmaking function) <br/>
3rd week of June onwards: Implement machine learning for accurate matchmaking (based on user’s details) <br/>
4th week of June: Testing and debugging <br/>
1st week of July: Implementation of peer teams’ suggestions <br/>
2nd week of July: Finalize machine learning algorithm and home page, portal designs <br/>
3rd week of July: Testing and debugging <br/>





Milestone features:<br/>

Milestone 1:<br/>
Basic layout and design for login and sign up pages<br/>
Basic login feature with default username and password<br/>

Milestone 2:<br/>
Improved login and sign up function with email and password, connected to database<br/>
Added profile page to input details<br/>
Added users page showcasing all registered users (this is very basic currently, to create a working prototype to allow users to find matches manually as we are still in the process of implementing matchmaking)

Milestone 3:<br/>
Matchmaking system using machine learning algorithm<br/>
Further improve display of user details<br/>

Milestone 3

Hobbyscore system

In order to match users better, we have created a hobbyscore system designed to use machine learning elements to predict a score based on certain inputs.

Firstly, users will fill in values from 1 to 10 for these categories:
Interest in the hobby
Commitment level (availability)
Age

Users with similar inputs will then obtain a similar score which would simplify matching.

Based on the dataset we have created, we implemented a linear regression algorithm to predict and display a score. (Hobbyscore calculator : https://hobbyland.herokuapp.com/)
